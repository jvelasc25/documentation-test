   AD-GMSL522-SL GMSL Board

The :adi:`AD-GMSL522-SL` is a
:adi:`Gigabit Multimedia Serial Link(GMSL) <en/solutions/gigabit-mulitimedia-serial-link.html>`-enabled
NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX-based hardware and software solution that allows for
prototyping with GMSL technology. This solution creates a scalable, user
friendly, GMSL platform for receiving and transmitting data over GMSL. It
supports two forms of camera input â€“ either straight CSI data coming through a
SAMTEC connector from a GMSL evaluation kit, or via camera modules using GMSL2
or GMSL1 technology to connect to the on-board :adi:`MAX96724` via
COAX connectors. The package also includes software tools to enable
development of GMSL applications. Among these tools are modified L4T kernels
that support certain camera modules and documentation that allows any user to
update these kernels for their specific hardware needs. The design also
incorporates the MAX96724GTN/VY+ Quad tunneling GMSL2/1 to CSI-2 deserializer
and MAX96717GTJ/VY+ CSI-2 to GMSL2 serializer and provides a reliable platform
to evaluate high-bandwidth GMSL.
