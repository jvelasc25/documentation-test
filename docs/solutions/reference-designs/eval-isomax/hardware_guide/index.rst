Hardware User Guide
===================

Overview
--------

The :adi:`EVAL-ISOMAX` is an integrated dual isoSPI adapter and microcontroller
board featuring the MAX32670 high-reliability, ultralow power microcontroller
and the ADBMS6822 dual isoSPI transceiver. This board allows multiple ADBMS68xx
battery monitors to be connected through daisy chain configuration.

The EVAL-ISOMAX also features reversible isoSPI, which enables a redundant path
to the peripheral units. The PCB components and DuraClik connectors are
optimized for low electromagnetic interference (EMI) susceptibility and
emissions.

Hardware Setup when using EVAL-ISOMAX as a Standalone MCU with Other BMS Boards
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section describes the procedure for establishing hardware connection
between the EVAL-ISOMAX and other ADI Broad Market BMS boards, how to download
the software files such as the firmware and GUI installer, and eventually obtain
and view BMS readings through the BMS graphical user interface.

Before you proceed with the system setup, make sure you have the following:

Equipment Needed
---------------------

**Boards**

* 1x :adi:`EVAL-ISOMAX` Dual isoSPI Adapter and Microcontroller Board
* 2x :adi:`EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW` 16-Channel Battery Cell Monitor
* 1x :adi:`EVAL-ADBMS2950-BASIC` Battery Pack Monitor

* 2x wall plugs (to plug USB cable from DC2472A to provide power)

Software Needed
---------------

The BMS Broadmarket Browser GUI is a PC browser-based graphical user interface
(GUI) tool designed to work in conjunction with the ADI Broad Market BMS devices.

**MyAnalog.com account is required in downloading the BMS Browser GUI** from
:adi:`BMS Browser GUI Version 2.0.0 <en/resources/evaluation-hardware-and-software/software/software-download.html?swpart=SD_ELPTRFU>`

When software updates or new versions of the software are available, an email
notification will be sent to the email address associated with the MyAnalog
account used to download the original software package.

Programming the MCU using the MAX32625PICO Adapter
--------------------------------------------------

This procedure is required to be done before connecting other BMS boards to the EVAL-ISOMAX.

Make sure that you have downloaded and installed the BMS Browser GUI to the host
PC before programming the MCU.

**Follow these steps if the EVAL-ISOMAX is used as a standalone MCU:**

#. Download the firmware image:
   :git-max32625pico-firmware-images:`MAX32625PICO Firmware Image for MAX32670 MCU <master:bin/max32625_max32670evkit_if_crc_swd_v1.0.3.bin>`
#. Connect the MAX32625PICO to the Host PC using the microUSB to USB cable.
#. Press the button on the MAX32625PICO. **(Do not release the button until the MAINTENANCE drive is mounted)**.
#. Release the button once the MAINTENANCE drive is mounted.
#. Drag and drop the firmware image into the MAINTENANCE drive.
#. After a few seconds, the MAINTENANCE drive will disappear and be replaced
   by a drive named DAPLINK. This indicates that the process is complete, and
   the MAX32625PICO can now be used to flash the firmware.
#. Connect the MAX32625PICO to the EVAL-ISOMAX using the 10-pin SWD ribbon cable.
#. Connect the EVAL-ISOMAX to the Host PC using a USB cable.
#. A DAPLINK drive should appear in Windows Explorer.

Uploading the EVAL-ISOMAX Firmware into the Broadmarket BMS Browser GUI Installer
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#. Download and extract the **EVAL-ISOMAX folder** in the host PC.
#. Copy and paste the entire **EVAL-ISOMAX folder** into the
   USB_TO_SPI directory inside the Broadmarket BMS GUI installation folder.

   **Location: C:\\Analog Devices\\BMS_Browser_GUI_Broadmarket-Rel2.0.0\\USB_TO_SPI_Firmware**

   .. figure:: copying_the_eval-isomax_folder.png

      Copying the EVAL-ISOMAX Folder

#. Make sure that the copied folder contains the **isomax32670-usb-to-spi.hex** file.

   .. figure:: eval-isomax_folder_contents.png

      EVAL-ISOMAX .hex file

#. The EVAL-ISOMAX board is now ready to be used with the Broadmarket BMS
   Browser GUI. Refer to the next sections for procedure on how to set up the
   hardware for evaluation.

Battery Cell Monitoring (EVAL-ISOMAX + EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW)
----------------------------------------------------------

Hardware Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DC2472A Battery Emulator Board is used for cell voltage input in this setup.
Alternatively, resistors can be used to simulate battery cell voltages. 100 Ω ½
W or equivalent resistors are recommended because 100 Ω (or lower values)
typically will not induce measurement errors, and the ½ W (or greater rating)
will keep the resistor temperatures low, preventing power dissipation damage.

Check the :dokuwiki:`EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW User Guide <resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adbms6830bmsw>` for procedure on
connecting resistors.

.. figure:: isomax_6830.png
   :width: 600 px

   Cell Monitoring Setup

#. Plug the screw-terminal block into the cell voltage connector of the DC2472A
   battery emulator board. Note that the last three terminals of the DC2472A
   must be left hanging.
#. Connect the DC2472A battery emulator board to the EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW through
   the connected cell voltage connectors (J1).
#. Connect a 5 V external power source to the DC2472A (J1) using a USB cable.
   Alternatively, power it through PC using a USB cable to be connected via J10.

   * While some laptop USB ports may suffice for powering the emulator during evaluation, it is still recommended to use an external power supply to ensure adequate power. Note that the EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW is powered through the DC2472A.

#. Connect the EVAL-ISOMAX (P6) to the EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW (J3) using the 2-wire twisted-pair patch cable from the main DuraClik connector to isoSPI A DuraClik connector.
#. Plug the micro-USB to USB cable into P15 of the EVAL-ISOMAX. Connect the other end to a PC/Laptop. DS3 (Green), DS2 (Red), and DS5 (Red) LEDs should light up indicating a default power up.
#. Connect the 10-pin SWD debugger cable to port P12 of the EVAL-ISOMAX. Connect the other end of the SWD debugger cable to the MAX32625PICO. Observe correct polarity when connecting the SWD cable.
#. Use the micro-USB to USB cable to connect the MAX32625PICO to the PC/Laptop.

Testing the Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Open the BMS Browser GUI.
#. In the **Interface Connection** section, select the COM port associated
   with the EVAL-ISOMAX.

   EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW.

   * Ensure the EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW board is powered correctly, indicated by the Blue LED on the DC2472A emulator board being illuminated.
   * Verify the connection of the twisted cable between the EVAL-ISOMAX and the EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW.

#. Check the voltage readings by adjusting the potentiometer (POT1) on the DC2472A to modify the emulated cell voltages.

     under the **Sequences** column to load the defined sequences from the
     **ADBMS6830-ADBMS2950.json** file into the tool.
   * Next, select **Loop Sequence** and then click on **General Readback Loop**
     under the **Sequences** column. This action loads the loop sequence defined
     in the **ADBMS6830-ADBMS2950.json** file into the tool.
   * Finally, click on **Start Freerun** to initiate the freerun mode.

#. During free run mode, the Initialization Sequence is performed once initially.
   Subsequently, the loop sequence continues to run continuously until the
   **Stop Freerun** button is clicked.
#. After activating freerun mode, navigate to the **Memory Map** tab.
   This section displays a numerical representation of the ongoing command loop.
   Additional details can be accessed in the GUI's help section.
   The accompanying screenshot illustrates this output.

#. The **Plots** tab allows for the visualization of parameters recorded during
   the command loop. It supports the creation of up to four plots simultaneously.
   In the configured Daisy Chain, the EVAL-ADBMS2950-BASIC is designated as Device 1,
   the first EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW as Device 2, and the third EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW as Device 3.
   An example illustrates how to plot each parameter separately:
   I1ACC and I2ACC on Plot 1, the average cell voltages for the first
   EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW on Plot 2, and the averaged cell voltages for the third
   EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW on Plot 3.

   Simply choose the desired Plot number from the dropdown menu under each device
   to display the relevant data.
