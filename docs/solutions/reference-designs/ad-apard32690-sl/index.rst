Introduction
------------

The :adi:`AD-APARD32690-SL <AD-APARD32690-SL>` is an Arduino Form-factor
Development Platform based on :adi:`MAX32690 <MAX32690>` ARM Cortex-M4
Microcontroller, targeted for prototyping intelligent, secure, and connected
industrial field devices. Some of the main features and benefits include:

- Arduino Mega-compatible form factor
- Two Pmod™-compatible connectors
- ARM Cortex-M4 Ultra Efficient Microcontroller with integrated Bluetooth 5.2 LE
- WiFi connectivity
- Long-range, single-pair 10BASE-T1L Ethernet interface
- Built-in security for root-of-trust, mutual authentication, data confidentiality and integrity, secure boot, and secure communications
- Open-source software stack

    Software Architecture

The :adi:`AD-APARD32690-SL <AD-APARD32690-SL>` firmware is based on ADI’s
open-source no-OS framework. It includes the bare-metal device drivers for all
the components in the system as well as example applications enabling
connectivity via the 10BASE-T1L interface for system configuration and data
transfer.
