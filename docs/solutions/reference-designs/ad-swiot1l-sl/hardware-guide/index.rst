Introduction
--------------

The :adi:`AD-SWIOT1L-SL` design incorporates the :adi:`AD74413R` Quad-Channel, Software Configurable Input and Output
and the :adi:`MAX14906` Quad-Channel industrial Digital
Output/Digital Input ICs, allowing the multiplexing of several analog and
digital functions on four channels which can be independently configurable
through software to act as:

-  Voltage Input or Output
-  Current Input or Output
-  Digital Input or Output
-  RTD Measurement

A 10 Mbps single-pair Ethernet link, using the :adi:`ADIN1110`
10BASE-T1L MAC/PHY, enables remote data acquisition and device configuration.
The 10BASE-T1L interface can also be used for powering the system via the
Single-pair Power over Ethernet (SPoE) technology using the
:adi:`LTC9111` Powered Device (PD) controller. This way power and
data for the system are provided over the same cable to simplify the cabling
infrastructure and cost significantly.

The system can be powered from an external 24 V supply for applications
requiring high current capabilities. Up to 1.2 A can be output on any channel
configured as a digital output. The power supply solution also includes the
:adi:`ADP1032` high-performance, isolated micropower management unit
(PMU) to provide power and digital control for software-configurable I/O devices
in one of the most compact formats. The :adi:`LT8304` Micropower
No-Opto Isolated Flyback Converter together with :adi:`MAX17671` and
:adi:`ADP223` completes the power tree to provide power to the digital
part of the design.

The onboard :adi:`MAX32650` ultralow power ARM® Cortex®-M4
microprocessor exposes all the necessary debug and programming features to
enable a complete software development experience with the system. It is coupled
with 1 Gb RAM and 64 Mb Flash external memories to meet the most demanding
applications and provide the flexibility to implement any protocol stack.
Security features are enabled by the :adi:`MAXQ1065` security
coprocessor. The system’s firmware is based on ADI’s open-source no-OS framework
and a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for evaluation and further
development.

The figures represented below illustrate the main components used in the
:adi:`AD-SWIOT1L-SL` project.

Front-end
---------

In order to obtain a system that is software configurable I/O, the hardware
portion which composes the front end of the :adi:`AD74413R` and
:adi:`MAX14906` combination needs to be designed to accommodate all
available analog and digital functions.

    Front-end Devices

The 220 pF capacitor connected to the **CCOMP_x** pins
allows the :adi:`AD74413R` to drive high capacitive loads in the
voltage output use case.

The P channel FET is used to lower power dissipation on the
:adi:`AD74413R` die in cases where a low resistive load is present.

The 2 kΩ resistor connected to the **SENSEH_x** pins is used to close the loop in
the current output mode. The low tolerance of this resistor and R\ :sub:`SENSE`
(0.1%) is required to improve accuracy in RTD measurements.

The other 2 kΩ resistor connected to the **SENSEL_x** pins is also used to close
the loop in voltage output mode, besides the current output one.

The R\ :sub:`FILTER` and C\ :sub:`FILTER` components connected to the
**SENSEHF_x** and **SENSELF_x** pins are used to measure the current through the
R\ :sub:`SENSE` or the voltage between the I/OP_x and I/ON_x screw terminals.

The TVS diodes connected on each I/OP_x and I/ON_x screw terminals have the
purpose to provide protection against overvoltages (±40 V DC).

The 470 pF capacitors connected to each DOIx pins on the
:adi:`MAX14906` are required for ESD protection.

The **LOAD** can be any analog or digital industrial device or instrument.

Power Supply Options
--------------------

The :adi:`AD-SWIOT1L-SL` board can be powered in two ways:

.. figure:: swiot1l_p4_p3.png
    :width: 400 px 

    :adi:`AD-SWIOT1L-SL` Power Supply

- Power from an external 24 V supply via the **“24 V TERMINAL BLOCK”**, P4
  connector on the board.
- Power from an SPoE supply via the **“10BASE-T1L TERMINAL BLOCK”**, P3
  connector on the board.

Each pin function is indicated in a drawing on the PCB board like in the right
side picture.

.. figure:: swiot1l_s2.png
    :width: 400 px

    :adi:`AD-SWIOT1L-SL` Power Switch

If both power supplies are in the system simultaneously, the
system will take power from the external power supply connected to the **“24 V
TERMINAL BLOCK”**.

The design also includes a **“POWER SWITCH”** to switch the power (24 V) source.
The power source for :adi:`MAX14906` can the from the
:adi:`ADP1032` internal supply, or from the external power supply.

To quickly identify the **“POWER SWITCH”** position and meaning, a table is
drawn on the PCB board like in the right side picture.

|

For high-power applications which require the usage of
:adi:`MAX14906` (Industrial Digital I/O) device, the system will
need to be powered from an external supply with the **“POWER SWITCH”** commuted
to the external supply position like in the figure represented below.

.. note:: 

     The greyed-out portions from the figures below represent circuits not used in that particular configuration.

.. figure:: swiot1l_at_full_power.png

    :adi:`AD-SWIOT1L-SL` at Full Power

|

If the **“POWER SWITCH”** is commuted to the internal supply position like in
the figure represented below, the :adi:`MAX14906` will not function
at full power, such that it will be necessary to take care of how the device is
configured.

.. figure:: swiot1l_at_mid_power.png

    :adi:`AD-SWIOT1L-SL` at Mid Power

|

If the system is powered from a Single-pair Power over Ethernet (SPoE) supply,
like the :adi:`EVAL-SPoE-KIT-AZ`, via the **“10BASE-T1L
TERMINAL BLOCK”**, as is illustrated in the figure below, the
:adi:`MAX14906` will not function at full power, but is still usable
depending on the application.

.. important::
    
     Care should be taken into consideration to flip the **“POWER
     SWITCH”** into the internal power supply position to avoid the situation to
     establish communication with an unpowered device, which may trigger a software crash.

Power Supply Timing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As described above, the system can be powered in two ways: from the SPoE power
supply or the external power supply connector.

No matter how the system is powered, the primary supply voltage, which can be
24 V or 36 V, will power the main supplies (:adi:`ADP1032` and
:adi:`MAX17671`) for both sections of the system (**“FIELD POWER”**
and **“CONTROLLER POWER”**) as illustrated above.

The figures illustrated below represent the power-up sequence for the main
supplies (:adi:`ADP1032` and :adi:`MAX17671`), when the
system is powered from the external 24 V power supply (**left**), and when the
system is powered from an SPoE power supply (**right**).

On the right side illustration, when the system is powered from an SPoE power
supply, it can also be observed the Serial Communication Classification
Protocol (SCCP) transaction, before the power (24 V) is turned on.

     SPoE Power Supply

-----------------------------------------

After that, the “CONTROLLER POWER” section will be powered by
:adi:`MAX17671` together with :adi:`ADP223` (**left side
illustration**) to provide the 3.3 V, 1.8 V, and 1.1 V voltages for the
:adi:`MAX32650` and the rest of the peripherals, including one side
of the digital interface.

At the same time, the “FIELD POWER” section is powered by
:adi:`ADP1032` (**right side illustration**) to provide the 24 V and
3.3 V voltages for :adi:`AD74413R`, :adi:`MAX14906`, and
the rest of the peripherals which compose one side of the digital interface.

Protection
----------

On the 24 V external power supply, the AD-SWIOT1L-SL board is protected against
surges by a TVS diode.

The :adi:`MAX14906` is protected against electrostatic discharge
(ESD) events by a ceramic capacitor of 470 pF, 100 V on each DOI\_ pin and by a
ceramic capacitor of 1 μF, 100 V on each VDD\_ pin. Also, reverse current
protection is provided for :adi:`MAX14906` by using a P-channel
transistor on each VDD\_ pin.

Each :adi:`AD74413R` channel is protected against overvoltages (±40
V) via a TVS diode.

On the networking side, the :adi:`ADIN1110` is protected against
surges via ESD suppressors.

The SPoE power supply, composed from :adi:`LTC9111` circuitry also
provides protection against overvoltages (+40 V).

Software I/O Connections
------------------------

.. figure:: swiot1l_channels_connections.png

    AD-SWIOT1L-SL Channels

Since this system has 4 channels, which can
be configured with different functions, to control or monitor different
industrial sensors, actuators, or other devices, to identify pin functions and
channel names easily, a drawing is added on the PCB.

The screw terminals tolerate overvoltages up to ± 40 V DC.

The system is designed to be robust in noisy environments and can withstand
overvoltage scenarios such as miswire and surge events.

Isolation
---------

.. figure:: ad-swiot1l-brd_isolation.png

    AD-SWIOT1L-SL Isolation Circuitry

To provide a minimum of safety to the design from eventual energy surges during
operation or setup installation, to protect the digital section of the design
which contains the MCU (:adi:`MAX32650`) and other sensitive
devices, the field devices :adi:`AD74413R`,
:adi:`MAX14906` and the eventual device connected on the PMOD
connector are isolated from the rest of the system via digital isolators and
isolated power supplies plus a galvanic isolated barrier.

The components used for digital and power isolation on the
:adi:`AD-SWIOT1L-SL` board meet the requirements for an
industrial application.

For digital isolation the following components are used:
:adi:`MAX12930`, :adi:`MAX14483` and optionally
:adi:`MAX14933` while for power
`ZA9644-AED <https://www.coilcraft.com/en-us/products/transformers/power-transformers/power-converter-transformers/za9384/za9644-ae/>`__
and `750315836 <https://www.we-online.com/en/components/icref/analog-devices/LT8304-Flyback-5>`__
transformers and :adi:`ADP1032` which also provide isolation for some
digital signals.

Feature Expansion
-----------------

A PMOD connector, **P2**, is present on the board for feature expansion reasons, in
order to extend the platform capabilities. For this, an SPI interface with an
additional output signal and power is exposed on the PMOD connector.

There are also placeholders for additional digital isolators (U12, U13, and U14)
to enable if necessary direct control or monitoring for all channels without
using only the SPI interface. This may be necessary for high-speed process
control applications.

10BASE-T1L Interfacing
----------------------

.. figure:: ad-t1lusb2.0-ebz.jpg
    :width: 400 px

    AD-T1LUSB-EBZ 10BASE-T1L to USB Adapter

The :adi:`AD-SWIOT1L-SL` kit includes a
10BASE-T1L to USB adapter :adi:`AD-T1LUSB2.0-EBZ` which is useful to directly
control the board via a USB connection.

.. note:: 
     
      Check out here the :dokuwiki:`User Guide for AD-T1LUSB2.0-EBZ <resources/eval/user-guides/ad-t1lusb-ebz>`

Besides this, other 10BASE-T1L media converters like the
:adi:`EVAL-ADIN1100` can be used to directly interface the
AD-SWIOT1L-SL board on an Ethernet network.

Single-pair Power over Ethernet (SPoE)
--------------------------------------

.. figure:: swiot1l_with_spoe.jpg

    AD-SWIOT1L-SL Powered via SPoE

As mentioned earlier, in the introduction section, the AD-SWIOT1L-SL board can
be powered via the SPoE technology. For this, we mainly need to use the
:adi:`LTC9111` Powered Device (PD) controller, included on the board,
and the companion part :adi:`LTC4296-1` five port, Single-pair
Power over Ethernet (SPoE), Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) controller.

The purpose of the :adi:`LTC9111` PD controller is to communicate the
power classification and to provide protection against undervoltage or
overvoltage scenarios. In contrast, the :adi:`LTC4296-1` PSE
controller will initiate the communication for power classification and it will
provide protection against overcurrents and other energy surges events.

The communication between PD classification is made via the Serial Communication
Classification Protocol (SCCP) and is initiated before the power over data lines
is turned on.

On the AD-SWIOT1L-SL board, the :adi:`LTC9111` circuitry is
configurated to function as a class 12 PD device, which means that it will only
function together with a PSE equipment configurated only in class 12.

LED Indicators
--------------

.. figure:: ad-swiot1l-brd_leds.png

    AD-SWIOT1L-SL LED Indicators

There are a couple of LEDs present on the board which are used to indicate
particular system statuses.

To easily identify if the system is powered properly, there is a green LED
around the :adi:`ADP1032` power supply which will indicate if the 24
V and 3.3 V rails for the software configurable I/0 devices are within margins,
by being lit and another green LED which will be also lit if the 24 V supply for
:adi:`MAX14906` is present.

Around the :adi:`ADIN1110` there are also two LEDs, green and
yellow, which depending on the software configuration, can be used to indicate
different network statuses.

The :adi:`MAX14906` has also a LED matrix, with red and green LEDs,
that can be used to eider indicate the channels’ statuses and faults or can be
used as general-purpose indicators.

Finally, there are also two green LEDs around the P1 programming connector (SWD)
which can be controlled directly by the :adi:`MAX32650`
microcontroller (MCU).

Thermal Info
------------

.. figure:: swiot1l_idle.jpg
    :width: 400 px

    AD-SWIOT1L-SL Idle Mode Temperature

The operating temperature of the AD-SWIOT1L-SL board before it is configured will be around 10°C
over the ambient temperature.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. figure:: ad74413r_max_power.jpg
    :width: 400 px

    AD74413R Maximum Temperature

The maximum temperature of the
:adi:`AD74413R` circuitry when is operating at maximum power.

This is the situation when all channels are using the
:adi:`AD74413R` sourcing functions at the maximum limit, for
example, all channels are sourcing 25 mA.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. figure:: max14906_max_power.jpg
    :width: 400 px

    MAX14906 Maximum Temperature

 The maximum temperature of the
:adi:`MAX14906` circuitry when is operating at maximum power.

This is the situation when all channels are using the
:adi:`MAX14906` digital output functions with the current limit set
at maximum and a load that is draining almost the maximum available power, for
example, from all channels the load is draining 1.2 A.

This is usually the worst-case scenario when the AD-SWIOT1L-SL board will heat
up at the highest temperature.
