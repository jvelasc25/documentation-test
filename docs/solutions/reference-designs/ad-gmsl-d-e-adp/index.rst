    AD-GMSL-D-E-ADP# GMSL Adapter Board

The **AD-GMSL-D-E-ADP# GMSL oLDI/LVDS to HDMI adapter** converts oLDI/LVDS
signals from GMSL Deserializers to standard HDMI 2.0 output. This adapter is
to be used for debug and system testing only and is not designed to be fully
implemented in a final system architecture.

The adapter is designed to fit all GMSL oLDI Deserializers Evaluation Boards
using the equipped Samtec board-to-board connectors. It utilizes automatic
configuration by “seeing” the incoming oLDI/LVDS signals and adjusting the
HDMI’s output based upon the received signals. A UART output is available to
be used for monitoring the automatic configuration process.

The adapter includes inputs for I2S audio and was designed in such a way that
the GMSL I2S signals (from the forward channel) could be used as inputs. Like
the video setup, the adapter automatically detects and adds the I2S audio data
into the HDMI signals without the need to program the adapter itself.

Adapter Setup
-------------------

    Standard GMSL oLDI Deserializer Connectors

The **AD-GMSL-D-E-ADP# GMSL adapter** is designed to fit all GMSL oLDI
Deserializers Evaluation boards using the equipped Samtec board-to-board
connectors.

.. important::
    It is critical that this procedure is followed
    in every installation of this GMSL adapter; not doing so could incur permanent
    damage to the adapter. 

The installation steps are as follows:

#. Start with the Deserializer (EvKit) completely unplugged from all connections
   **This includes the GMSL Link, USB, oLDI Screen, and Power.**
#. With the unconnected EvKit, install standoff screws and nuts.
   
     .. figure:: installing_standoff_screws.png
        :width: 400 px

        Connecting Standoff Screws

#. Connect the **AD-GMSL-D-E-ADP# GMSL adapter** to the Deserializer (EvKit)
   through the Samtec board-to-board connector.
#. Make sure that **AD-GMSL-D-E-ADP# GMSL adapter** is firmly attached and
   evenly seated in the Samtec port. 

     .. important:: Do not overtighten the screws as this may cause the EvKit PCB to bend.

        Attaching the Deserializer to the AD-GMSL-D-E-ADP#

#. Connect the GMSL cable.

        Connecting the GMSL Cable

#. Connect the micro-USB to USB cable. 
     .. figure:: connecting_usb_cable.png
        :width: 400 px

        Connecting the USB Cable

#. Connect one end of the HDMI cable to **AD-GMSL-D-E-ADP# GMSL adapter** and
   then the other end to the HDMI display monitor.

#. Connect the 12 V power adapter cable. 
     .. figure:: connecting_the_power_cable.png
        :width: 500 px

        Connecting the Power Cable

#. Power ON the EvKit by sliding the power switch as shown below.
     .. figure:: power_switch.png
        :width: 500 px

        Deserializer Power Switch

#. Confirm if GMSL link has been established. The Lock LEDs on the EvKits light
   up, indicating that links are set up properly. Also, the Power LED on the
   **AD-GMSL-D-E-ADP# GMSL adapter** will light up as an indication that boards
   are properly supplied with required power.

Deserializer Configuration
---------------------------------

The **AD-GMSL-D-E-ADP# GMSL adapter** utilizes automatic configuration by
“seeing” the incoming oLDI/LVDS signals and adjusting the HDMI’s output based
upon the received signals. For the adapter to operate, the GMSL Deserializer
must be configured to output the appropriate signals. Note that the steps
outlined below contains the Deserializer’s setup only and doesn’t include the
setup for the Serializer.

#. For **Daisy-Chain capable devices**, configure **Register 0x05, bits [7:6] to be 0x1, 0x2, 0x3** –- this enables the video port output.
#. For **All Devices**, set **Register 0x1CE to be 0x4E** –- this configures the oLDI ports for dual oLDI port operation using VESA LVDS signaling.
#. Perform normal setup for the Serializer.
#. After the above steps are completed, video output should be flowing to the connected HDMI-capable monitor.

HDMI Audio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **AD-GMSL-D-E-ADP# GMSL adapter** includes inputs for I2S audio and was
designed in such a way that the GMSL I2S signals (from the forward channel)
could be used as inputs into the adapter. Like the video setup, the adapter
automatically detects and adds the I2S audio data into the HDMI signals without
the need to program the adapter itself.

Follow below procedure for audio hardware setup:

#. Power OFF the board Deserializer (EvKit) and disconnect the 12 V power
   supply.
#. Jump the following signals on **J6**: SCK to SCK, SD to SPDIF, and WS to WS.

        J6 Signals

#. Reinstall the **AD-GMSL-D-E-ADP# GMSL adapter** and apply power to the Deserializer.
#. Perform normal video setup, as described in the *Deserializer Configuration* section.
#. Perform normal audio setup based on your audio device’s setup instructions.
#. At this point, both audio and video should be running for your system.

UART Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This adapter utilizes automatic configuration by “seeing” the incoming
oLDI/LVDS signals and adjusting the HDMI’s output based upon the received
signals. This process can be monitored by using the adapter’s UART output.

This requires connections from two pins on the adapter to a logic analyzer.

#. Power OFF and DISCONNECT the Deserializer’s 12 V power supply before setting
   up the UART connections.
#. Connect the logic analyzer to **Pin GP4 & GND** of the **AD-GMSL-D-E-ADP# GMSL adapter**.
#. Below example shows the settings used for the SALEAE Logic Analyzer.
     .. figure:: async_serial_protocol_analyzer_settings.png
       :width: 600 px 

       Async Serial Protocol Analyzer Settings

#. After configuring the Async Serial protocol analyzer using the above
   settings, start the data capture.
#. Open the logic analyzer’s terminal to check the stream of text while the
   device is being set up.
#. Set up the Deserializer based on the procedure described in the *Deserializer Configuration* section.
#. The terminal stream should display a plain text readout with the following
   information:
     .. figure:: terminal_stream_readout.png

        Sample Readout in Terminal

.. tip:: 
    If no video is flowing, the UART output should only
    be consist of the first two lines of text. Once video is active, the other lines
    will be printed.
