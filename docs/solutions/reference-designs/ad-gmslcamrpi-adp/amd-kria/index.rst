System Setup
--------------

.. figure:: kria_adapter.jpg

    Hardware Setup with AMD Kria SoM

#. Write the `AMD Kria latest SD card image <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/gmsl#platforms-user-guides-sd-card-images-and-build-instructions>`__ on a 8GB (or more) SD card
#. Plug the SD card into the Kria SD card slot.
#. Connect the HDMI cable from the monitor to the Kria HDMI connector.
#. Connect the 2 Tier 4 C1 cameras to INA and INB of the deserializer board.
#. Connect the 15 pins camera cable between the Kria and the P1 connector of the interposer. **Make sure to use the cable with contacts on the same sides.**
#. Connect the 22 pin flex cable.
#. Connect the Kria to the power supply.
#. Kria will boot by default from QSPI. It must be forced to boot from SD card to correctly load the custom BOOT.BIN. For this please follow the guide `here <https://xilinx.github.io/kria-apps-docs/creating_applications/2022.1/build/html/docs/bootmodes.html>`__ and run **boot_sd** boot mode.
#. Connect a USB mouse and keyboard to the Kria. It’s possible to use either a mouse and keyboard combo or a separate mouse and keyboard.

       Ubuntu credentials 

      * user:analog
      * pass:analog

.. note:: 
     To change the number of cameras that would be used in the setup, you would
     need to change the default devicetree binary that is located in the boot
     partition of the SD card to the corresponding number of cameras (between 1 and
     2), by overwriting the system.dtb to an one from the corresponding directory.

     The devicetree binary options are located in the bootfs partiiton (in
     **nr_cams/1cam or 2cams directory/system.dtb**). The **bootfs** partition can be
     mounted by using the mount utility: e.g., **mount /dev/mmcblk1p1 /mnt**.

Running the Evaluation Application
----------------------------------

Once Linux boots, you’ll see on the HDMI monitor the Linux desktop and on the top
left corner a shortcut to the script named **video_cfg.sh**. Double-clicking on
the icon will start the media-ctl configuration script. The script is running in
background without any pop-ups.

.. figure:: kria_video_cfg.png

    Kria Video Configuration Script

After the script was executed once, one should double-click on Qt V4L2 test
Utility icon to start the video capture application. A window like below should
open. First, the user must select **video0** device by clicking the open icon.

.. figure:: qv4l2_select_video_dev.png

    Selecting Video Device

A new instance of Qt V4L2 test Utility should be started and selected **video1**
this time. After this step the play button should be pressed on both Qt V4L2
test Utility instances. Video should be visible on the 2 windows.

.. figure:: qv4l2_video.jpg

    Starting a New Instance

OpenGL rendering is recommended to be disabled by accessing Qt V4L2 test Utility
capture menu. Capture will start only if both Qt V4L2 test Utility instances are
on play state. This is a current HDL limitation.


Power off sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Open a terminal and type **sudo poweroff**. This will safely power off the Kria and ensure that the SD card is properly unmounted.



Getting the Software
--------------------

The GMSL Linux kernel drivers, the complete Linux distributions for the
supported processing platforms, and software user guides can be found on the
`Analog Devices GMSL github repository <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/gmsl>`__.
