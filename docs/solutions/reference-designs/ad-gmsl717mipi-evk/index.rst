    AD-GMSL717MIPI-EVK GMSL2 Serializer Board for Raspberry Pi Cameras

The :adi:`AD-GMSL717MIPI-EVK` allows connecting a wide range of cameras with 15-pin
MIPI CSI-2 ribbon cable interfaces to Analog Devices’ MAX96717 GMSL2 serializer,
enabling connectivity to processing systems which have GMSL2 receive interfaces.
Due to its compact form-factor and mounting holes, the board can be easily and
securely integrated into vision systems with various requirements in terms of
size, shape, and mobility. A detachable extension allows mounting on tripods
with 1/4”-20 mounts.
