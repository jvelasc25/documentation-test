   AD-BMSE2E3W-SL

The :adi:`AD-BMSE2E3W-SL` is a BMS reference design for light electric vehicles (LEVs). With a voltage range of 72 V to 96 V, this solution is suitable for electric 2-wheeler and 3-wheeler vehicles with high current capacity ranging up to 100 A.

This single-board system utilizes the best-in-class ADBMS6830 cell monitoring chip that is capable of monitoring up to 2x 16-channel. This board also features battery pack monitoring using the ADBMS2950. The ADBMS6822 dual isoSPI transceiver provides a built-in 2-wire reversible isoSPI connection, which simplifies the communication of BMS parts in a daisy chain configuration before sending the data to SPI lines in the microcontroller.

The on-board MAX32690 MCU, when loaded with the firmware, can perform BMS measurements such as cell voltage (average and filtered), and pack voltage and pack current measurement. The board also has a charge, pre-charge, and discharge mode that can be controlled by the ADBMS2950 pack monitor chip.

The AD-BMSE2E3W-SL is designed to perform either in embedded mode or using a GUI, where it calculates the battery's State of Charge (SoC) and State of Health (SoH) through enhanced coulomb counting technique.

System Evaluation
+++++++++++++++++

Follow the setup shown in the diagram below to get the board up and running. Ensure that the hardware parts and equipment are complete based on list of Equipment Needed. The banana plug cables used in this setup only have a maximum rating of 10A. Cables suitable for higher current rating must be used if the intended application operates at range higher than 10A. Note that the AD-BMSE2E3W-SL board can only accommodate up to 100A.

.. warning::

   This reference design has not undergone compliant testing for EMI/ EMC standards for automotive. It is up for the user to do its qualification as the requirements vary depending on its end application or use cases.


.. esd-warning::

.. note::

   For high current applications requiring greater than 50 A, it is advisable to install a heat sink to protect the pre-charge, charge, and discharge MOSFETs from overheating.


   - The AD-BMSE2E3W-SL Kit has 7 available HEATSINK PIN-FIN W/TAPE (375424B00034G) easy-to-install, adhesive type, aluminum top mount heat sink than can be installed directly on top of the board.

   - Peel off the protective film from the bottom of each heat sink and firmly press each one on top of the following FETs:

   (1) Attach the 5 heat sinks on the top layer of the board (Q4, Q5, Q6, Q7, and Q9),
   (2) the remaining 2 heat sinks on the bottom layer of the board (Q3 and Q8).

Preparing the MCU
+++++++++++++++++

By default (upon purchase), the AD+BMSE2E3W+SL board comes with a MAX32625PICO programmer adapter that is loaded with firmware image.

Otherwise, if you are using a new MAX32625PICO programmer (that is not part of the original kit), make sure to flash it first with the correct firmware image before connecting it to the AD-BMSE2E3W-SL board. If you do not know how to load the image, follow the instructions below:

#. Download the firmware image:
   :downgit-max32625pico-firmware-images:`MAX32625PICO Firmware Image for MAX32690 <master:bin/max32625_max32690evkit_if_crc_swd_v1.0.7.bin>`

#. Do not connect the MAX32625PICO to the AD-BMSE2E3W-SL Board yet.

#. Connect the MAX32625PICO to the Host PC using the micro USB to USB cable.

#. Press the button on the MAX32625PICO. (Do not release the button until the MAINTENANCE drive is mounted)

#. Release the button once the MAINTENANCE drive is mounted.

#. Drag and drop (to the MAINTENANCE drive) the firmware image.

#. After a few seconds, the MAINTENANCE drive will disappear and be replaced by a drive named DAPLINK. This indicates that the process is complete, and the MAX32625PICO can now be used to flash the firmware of the AD-BMSE2E3W-SL Board.

Hardware Setup
++++++++++++++
The board utilizes the DC2472A battery emulator as input for cell voltage measurement. The DC2472A allows a cell voltage of 1.4 V (min) to 4.2 V (max). Follow below steps to set up the board for cell measurement:

#. Screw the two cell connector blocks to the two DC2472A battery emulators. Note that the first two terminals and the last terminal of each DC2472A cell connector must be left hanging (refer to below figure). Make sure to also set the last two terminals' input to low voltage or equivalent range of roughly 1.4V per cell.

      Connecting the DC2472A Battery Emulator

#. Set the DC2472A battery emulators to the lowest voltage by fully turning the Cell Voltage Adjustment Potentiometer counterclockwise.

#. Attach the MAX32625PICO programmer to the AD-BMSE2E3W-SL board using the 10-pin ribbon SWD cable. Power the MAX32625PICO using a micro-USB to USB cable connected to the Host PC.
